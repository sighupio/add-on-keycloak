# Keycloak Add-On Module Release v1.0.1

This is a patch release that aligns the module to the standard fury module layout.

## Changelog

- Add the latest Kubernetes Versions as E2E tests and support
  - Add missing e2e tests *(basic ones)*
- Modularize the documentation and the packages
  - Leave the basic KeyCloak as it is, then move other variants to the examples' directory.
    - [`h2-tests`](examples/h2-tests): Use only this option to test KeyCloak. It is used in the E2E tests.
    - [`external-cache`](examples/external-cache): Use this setup to run KeyCloak in a cluster across multiple data
    centers.
    - [`keycloak-4.8.2`](examples/keycloak-4.8.2): You should put your custom modifications to the official docker image
    here.

## Upgrade path

To upgrade this module from `v1.0.0` to `v1.0.1`, you need to download this new version, then apply the
`kustomize` project. No further action is required.

```bash
$ kustomize build katalog/keycloak | kubectl apply -f -
# Or
$ kustomize build examples/h2-tests | kubectl apply -f -
```
