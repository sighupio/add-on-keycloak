## Bug Fixes and Changes üêõ

- Updated Keycloak Operator and Operated to v26.2.2 .

- By default, starting from the previous release, the `--optimized` argument is passed to the `kc.sh` command. To handle this behavior you can set the `spec.startOptimized` option in `Keycloak Custom Resource`.

## Update Guide ü¶Æ

### Process

To upgrade this module from v2.2.0 to v2.3.0, execute the following:

```bash
KEYCLOAK_NS=<your_keycloak_namespace>

# Remove the old Keycloak Operator. This will not delete Keycloak instances.
kubectl delete deploy keycloak-operator -n $KEYCLOAK_NS

# Update Keycloak Operator and CRDs
kustomize build katalog/keycloak-operator | kubectl apply -n $KEYCLOAK_NS -f - 

```

N.B. It's not required to upgrade the `keycloak-operated` package, since the Operator will take care of updating the pods.


‚ÑπÔ∏è Known behaviour during upgrade

During the first reconciliation loop after the upgrade to Keycloak Operator v26.2.2, something like this can be observed:

```bash
Error during event processing
...
The timeout period of 10000ms has been exceeded while executing PATCH
...
Conflict during reconciliation

```

The operator will recover and complete the reconciliation after a few seconds.

No manual action is required.
