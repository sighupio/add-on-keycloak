## Bug Fixes and Changes üêõ

- Updating Keycloak to v26.2.2

- By default, the `--optimized` argument is now passed to the `kc.sh` command. To handle this behavior you can set the `spec.startOptimized` option in `Keycloak Custom Resource`.

N.B. It's not required to upgrade the `keycloak-operated` package, since the Operator will take care of updating the pods.
